Neural Networks in Python

<h1> Convolutional Neural Networks with Keras datasets </h1>
<p> First file is based on keras dataset of cilaf10. Image classification neural network - 'airplane','automobile', 'bird', 'cat','dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship' and 'truck'.</p>
<p> During preprocessing and exploration we can see the shapes of the training dataset. X values are 4 dimensional numpy arrays and Y values are 2 dimensional numpy arrays. We use the 4 dimensional numpy array to plot the image with the pixel values in x_train and use the same index value to attain the label attached to the training dataset. </p> 
<h3> 
index = 4
img = plt.imshow(x_train[index])
